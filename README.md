# Proofread-LaTeX-Paper

This repository provides a tool for proofreading academic papers in LaTeX format using LLM.
The entire text is proofread by dividing the text by a certain length and repeatedly requesting the GPT model.

## Prerequisites

### Python Environment
We highly recommend using Python 3.11 for the best performance. It is also advisable to operate within a virtual environment when executing the code.

### Libraries Installation
To install all necessary libraries, please execute the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

### GPT Model Configuration
1. Make a duplicate of the `config.default.ini` file and rename this duplicate to `config.ini`.
2. Open the `config.ini` file and insert your unique OpenAI API key into the `API_KEY` field. Remember not to enclose the key in quotation marks ("").
3. For the `GPT_MODEL` setting, our recommendation is to use `gpt-4`.

### Setting up the LaTeX Paper for Proofreading
1. Specify the path to the directory containing your target file in the `TARGET_FOLDER` field. For instance, if you have a folder named "target_folder" in the same directory as `main.py`, you would set `TARGET_FOLDER` to `./target_folder`.
2. Input the name of your LaTeX file in the `TARGET_FILE_NAME` field.
3. Adjust the `FILE_ENCODE` parameter to match the encoding of your file, if needed.

### Target Text for Proofreading
This tool is designed to proofread and revise the text within LaTeX academic papers, with the exception of the following sections:
* Preamble (any parts before the `\begin{document}`)
* Figures
* Tables
* References

## Running the Proofreading Tool
To run the proofreading tool, execute the `main.py` file with Python.

## Output File
The revised file is saved within the same directory as the original file. The output file's name includes the date Î©for easy tracking. For example, if the input file is 'document.tex', then the output file will be "document_20230516_161112.tex".

# Appendix

## Customizing the GPT Model Settings
If you wish to customize the GPT model's settings, such as the Prompt Text, you can do so by modifying the respective values in the `proofread-latex-paper/calc_libs/gpt_manager.py` file.

## Visualizing the differences

To check the revised parts, we recommend using a third-party tool such as `latexdiff`[1].

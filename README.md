# Proofread-LaTeX-Paper

This repository provides a tool for proofreading academic papers in LaTeX format using GPT model.
The entire text is proofread by dividing the text by a certain length and repeatedly requesting to the model.

## Basic

### _Python Environment_
We highly recommend using Python 3.11 for the best performance. It is also advisable to operate within a virtual environment when executing the code.

### _Code Installation_

1. Install Git on your computer if not already installed. 
2. Clone the repository using git clone as follows:
```
git clone https://github.com/git-kai/proofread-latex-paper.git.
```

### _Libraries Installation_
To install all necessary libraries, please execute the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### _GPT Model Configuration_
1. Make a duplicate of the `config.default.ini` file and rename this duplicate to `config.ini`.
2. Open the `config.ini` file and insert your unique OpenAI API key into the `API_KEY` field. Remember not to enclose the key in quotation marks ("").
3. For the `GPT_MODEL` setting, our recommendation is to use `gpt-4`.

### _Setting up the LaTeX Paper for Proofreading_
1. Specify the path to the directory containing your target file in the `TARGET_FOLDER` field. For instance, if you have a folder named "target_folder" in the same directory as `main.py`, you would set `TARGET_FOLDER` to `./target_folder`.
2. Input the name of your LaTeX file in the `TARGET_FILE_NAME` field.
3. Adjust the `FILE_ENCODE` parameter to match the encoding of your file, if needed.

### _Target Text for Proofreading_
This tool is designed to proofread and revise the text within LaTeX academic papers, with the exception of the following sections:
* Preamble (any parts before the `\begin{document}`)
* Figures
* Tables
* References

### _Running the Tool_
To run the proofreading tool, execute the `main.py` file with Python.

### _Getting Output_
The revised file is saved within the same directory as the original file. The output file's name includes the date Î©for easy tracking. For example, if the input file is 'document.tex', then the output file will be such as "document_20230516_161112.tex".

## Advanced

### _Customizing the GPT Model Settings_
If you wish to customize the GPT model's settings, such as the Prompt Text, you can do so by modifying the respective values in the `proofread-latex-paper/libs/gpt_manager.py` file.

### _Visualizing the differences_

To check the revised parts, we recommend using a third-party tool such as `latexdiff`[1].

## Caution!
Please check the policy of the journal or conference to which you intend to submit your paper.
It is probable that the policies prohibit the use of LLM.
